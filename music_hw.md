## Music Collection

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

## MVP

In their console they would like to be able to:

- Create and Save Artists
<!-- Done -->
- Create and Save Albums
<!-- Done -->
- Delete all Artists / Albums
<!-- Done for artists -->
- Find Artists/Albums by their ID (`select`)
<!-- Done -->
- List All Artists/Albums (`select_all`)
  <!-- Done -->
Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist.

## Further tasks

Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

- List all the albums by an artist
<!-- Done -->
- Edit Artists/Albums
<!-- Done -->
- Delete Artists/Albums by id
<!-- DONE -->

Remember to regularly git commit!
